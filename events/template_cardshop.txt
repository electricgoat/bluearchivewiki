==Card Draw==
A set of 4 cards will be presented to the players. Revealing the first card will cost {{wiki_price}}, and the price will increase by 10 for any subsequent card after it (200, 210, 220, and finally 230); player can reset the hand at any point instead of revealing the next card, resetting the cost. 
There are 4 rarities that can appear in the event card: SSR / Ultra Rare (Rainbow Border), Super Rare (Golden Border), Rare (Blue Border), and Normal (Gray Border). 
*Each set of 4 cards has a minimum of one SR or better card.
*All 4 cards are random and a set might not contain an UR card.
*Regardless of rarity, each card will always contain {{shop_currency}} which is required to exchange items from the 3rd Shop.
*Similar rarities will contain mostly the same rewards but at different quantities.
